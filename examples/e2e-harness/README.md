# e2e-harness

Headless inline-host subscribe used by `just e2e`.
It is not a human demo — see [subscribe-chatter](../subscribe-chatter/)
for the browser page.

The process imports `rcl-web` (the tsdown `dist/` bundle), calls `init`
with `inline: true`, creates a `Node`, subscribes to `/chatter`, waits
for a minimum sample count, prints `e2e ok`, and exits 0. Gateway URL
and wasm path come from the environment; compose files set those. The
e2e images run `bun run --filter rcl-web build` after staging wasm.
