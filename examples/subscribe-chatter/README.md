# subscribe-chatter

Browser page that connects to `rclwebd`, subscribes to `/chatter`, and
can publish `std_msgs/msg/String` samples. This is the public `rcl-web`
demo ([how to](../../docs/typescript.md), [API](../../docs/api.md)).
Leave the host empty for this machine (`init()`). Type a robot IP for
WebTransport (QUIC) from `http://127.0.0.1`. No certificate to install.
The demo binds loopback only.

## Run

1. Build the `rcl-web` browser bundle (also stages wasm):

   ```bash
   just build
   ```

   Or, if the native/wasm tree is already current:

   ```bash
   bun run --filter rcl-web build
   ```

2. Start the edge process on a machine that can attach to ROS:

   ```bash
   just gateway
   # or, after the ament overlay: ros2 run rclwebd rclwebd
   ```

3. Serve the page:

   ```bash
   bun run --filter @rclweb/subscribe-chatter start
   ```

   Open http://127.0.0.1:4173, click **Connect** for this machine, or
   type a robot host first. Send from the page or from a ROS talker on
   `/chatter`.

   Intranet WebTransport: `just gateway-wt` on the robot, keep this page
   on `http://127.0.0.1:4173`, type the robot IP. Chromium. That is the
   QUIC path. A tab opened via a LAN IP cannot use WebTransport.

| Variable | Default | Role |
|---|---|---|
| `PORT` | `4173` | HTTP port for the demo page |
| `RCLWEB_GATEWAY_URL` | empty | Prefills the host field (`192.168.1.10` for QUIC) |

The page loads `typescript/dist/index.js` (Worker path, not
`inline: true`). `just build` must have produced `dist/` first; the
server exits with a short error if that file is missing. The page uses
`init` + `Node` like rclcpp.
