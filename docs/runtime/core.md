# `rclweb` core

`rclweb` is the Rust core of the project: R2WP protocol codecs, CDR, and deterministic session/channel/ROS state. One codebase serves both sides of the wire — `rclwebd` links it natively, and the browser runtime is the same crate compiled to `wasm32-unknown-unknown` inside a TypeScript Worker host.

The R2WP v0 parsers, CDR core (`rclweb/src/cdr/`), session/channel state machine (`rclweb/src/session/`), sender-side encoders (`rclweb/src/protocol/encode.rs`), client connection engine (`rclweb/src/engine/`), and hand-written host poll ABI (`rclweb/src/host/`, ADR 0004) are complete. The TypeScript package wraps the wasm artifact. See [ADR 0010](../adr/0010-restructure-single-rust-core.md).

## Responsibilities

- R2WP framing, deterministic CBOR, control parsing, and validation order
- R2WP encoding (bootstrap, control frames, TLVs, data-frame headers) proven by round-trips against the parsers
- CDR encoding, decoding, validation, and field projection ([CDR contract](./cdr.md))
- Session and channel state for the v0.1 normative subset, including graph snapshot/delta and service/action channels
- Client connection engine (`Role::Client`) producing/consuming the control and sample path, including publish / `SendSample`
- Host poll ABI: bounded event batches in, outbound work / app events / released buffers / next deadline out
- QoS subset on OpenChannel (reliability + KEEP_LAST depth); remaining QoS and clocks stay later
- Structured errors and telemetry events, including copy counters and outbound `samples_sent`

## Wasm host boundary

The [ADR 0004](../adr/0004-browser-wasm-host-boundary.md) boundary is implemented as a hand-written poll ABI (not `wasm-bindgen`):

| Rust/Wasm owns | TypeScript host owns |
|---|---|
| CDR, schemas, protocol and ROS state, deadlines, structured events | Browser network APIs, Worker scheduling, timers, buffers, package Promises, application delivery |

Each host turn passes a bounded event batch into `poll`. Single-frame WS ingest of control and non-sample application frames uses `rclweb_poll_ws` (external-ptr, no 28-byte batch header). ROS_SAMPLE with no extension stays on the host ([ADR 0017](../adr/0017-host-retain-inbound-sample-payload.md)). Control and bootstrap still take the full frame. The result contains outbound work, completed operations, application events, released buffers, and the next deadline. Batch size, retained memory, and execution time are observable budgets. The transferable `ArrayBuffer` path is the general deployment; the `SharedArrayBuffer` ring is implemented on the host for measurement and stays evidence-gated for COOP/COEP production isolation per ADR 0004. The wasm artifact uses Talc rather than default dlmalloc ([performance](../performance.md)).

## CDR and buffers

The Rust CDR port implements the frozen [CDR core contract](./cdr.md) and must pass the committed corpus (56 fixtures, 18 comparison groups, tail-slack evidence, adversarial cases). Decoding blob-heavy types is O(1): metadata reads plus a borrowed (offset, length) view for bulk fields such as PointCloud2 `data` ([`cdr::point_cloud2`](../../rclweb/src/cdr/point_cloud2.rs)). On the wasm host that view is into the retained WebSocket buffer ([ADR 0017](../adr/0017-host-retain-inbound-sample-payload.md)). Codecs never materialize owned copies of bulk payloads; applications receive TypedArray views under the host lease model.

## Types and schemas

The dual-scheme registry contract ([generated types](./generated-types.md)) is
implemented in Rust (`rclweb/src/types/`): Bun generator metadata under
`rclweb/generated/metadata/`, production codecs for the nine corpus roots,
and an immutable `SchemaRegistry::phase1()` with representation-aware zero-tail
lookup. Jazzy uses `rep2011-rihs` identity; Humble uses `rclweb-schema-v1`
bundles (historical identifier, frozen on the wire). Wire SchemaRequest/Advertise/Response
exchange remains parked until a gateway schema-cache path lands.

## Validation

```bash
cargo test --locked -p rclweb
bun run scripts/build-wasm.ts
cargo build --locked -p rclweb --target wasm32-unknown-unknown --profile release-wasm
```

`just build` prints the staged wasm byte count as an [ADR 0010](../adr/0010-restructure-single-rust-core.md) reopen input. Copy counters live on the client engine (`EngineTelemetry`) and gateway (`/telemetryz`). [Validation](../validation.md) owns evidence and release gates. The crate publishes to crates.io ([release](../release.md)).
