# Performance

`just perf-baseline` times **bytes already in JS → usable ROS message** (latency / CPU / RSS). Stdout only; do not commit it. Two hop classes — do not mix them:

| Class | Work | Rows |
|---|---|---|
| decode | header skip + CDR (or `JSON.parse`) | `rclweb.cdrDecode`, `foxglove.cdrDecode`, `rosbridge.jsonDecode` |
| deliver | framed bytes → user callback | `rclweb.ingest`, `foxglove.deliver`, `rosbridge.deliver` |

`rclweb.ingest` pairs with `foxglove.deliver`. It does not pair with a 13-byte MessageData skip.

| | rosbridge JSON | Foxglove | rclweb |
|---|---|---|---|
| Wire | JSON; blobs as base64 | CDR + 13 B | CDR + 32 B |
| Gateway extra copy of CDR | 1 | 1 | **0** |
| Browser, usable message | `JSON.parse` (+ base64) | JS CDR decode | JS CDR decode (data is a view) |
| Controllable copies | 3 | 2 | **1** |

Foxglove views PointCloud2 `data` on the WS buffer. rclweb does the same: ROS_SAMPLE stays in JS, and PointCloud2 `data` is a view of those bytes ([ADR 0017](./adr/0017-host-retain-inbound-sample-payload.md)). Engineering p99 targets are e2e, in [validation](./validation.md#engineering-targets), and are not CI fails.

**Copy ceiling on this hop.** ROS_SAMPLE never enters wasm ([ADR 0017](./adr/0017-host-retain-inbound-sample-payload.md)). The 1 MiB memcpy, the 32-byte wasm header poll, and the idle-queue poll batch (enqueue / flush / `PollResult`) are closed. Host-lease `release()` is synchronous (no poll batch). The default I/O Worker transfers the host-retained WS/frame buffer to main (0 extra payload copies), including generated corpus msg roots and service/action CDR. Generated service/action sections decode in JS (`decodeOpPayload`). Wasm linear memory still cannot alias a WebSocket `ArrayBuffer` ([Wasm design #1162](https://github.com/WebAssembly/design/issues/1162)). Decode hops use the same JS CDR; a first-of-size run is not a codec loss (shared prewarm + inner batch). Remaining *deliver* latency on the inline probe is the host pin + `SampleLease` + typed sink versus Foxglove’s MessageData parse + subscription map. Live bridge e2e is another hop. RMW loans stay under [ADR 0006](./adr/0006-edge-ros-c-abi-boundary.md). `opt-level = 3` would reopen [ADR 0010](./adr/0010-restructure-single-rust-core.md) (`just build` size vs `just poll-latency`).

| Command | Measures |
|---|---|
| `just perf-baseline` | p50/p99/mean, CPU µs/sample, RSS at 1 KiB, 32 KiB, PointCloud2 ~1 MiB |
| `just perf-baseline-live` | Docker stamp latency + CPU/RSS vs foxglove_bridge and rosbridge |
| `just poll-latency` | Empty timer-poll (wasm size reopen input) |

## WebSocket

`init()` is local binary WebSocket. That is the happy path, not a
fallback we still owe a rewrite.

The sample already sits in one `Bytes` / `ArrayBuffer` from the RMW
take through `ws.send`. Framing is in-place. `binaryType` is
`arraybuffer`. Data channels do not enable permessage-deflate. The
I/O Worker transfers that buffer to main. None of those steps is a
second payload copy.

What WebSocket still costs, and what we leave alone:

- One TCP stream. A stalled reliable channel head-of-line blocks
  every other channel on the connection. That is the reason
  WebTransport exists (`init("192.168.1.10")` or
  `{ transport: "webtransport" }`), not because WebSocket memcpy's
  more.
- Kernel and browser RX buffers. They sit outside the controllable
  copy budget. Foxglove pays the same tax on the same hop.
- `just perf-baseline` starts after the bytes are already in JS. Use
  `just perf-baseline-live` when the socket is part of the claim.

Do not put ROS_SAMPLE back into wasm to "parse the socket faster".
Do not turn on permessage-deflate to "win" a large PointCloud2.
Do not make local `init()` imply QUIC. Default `rclwebd` does not
offer it.
