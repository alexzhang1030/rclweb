# 0018: Prebuilt gateway distribution and support-row auto-detection

## Status

Accepted

## Date

2026-08-14

## Context

Getting a running `rclwebd` today is hard in three independent ways:

- `cargo install rclwebd --features ros` needs a Rust toolchain **and** a
  full ROS 2 prefix with rcl/rmw development libraries at link time, then
  compiles the whole gateway from source. Someone who only wants to point
  a browser at a robot pays a robotics-plus-Rust setup cost.
- The runtime images ([deploy](../deploy.md)) exist only as local builds
  (`just image-rclwebd`, `just gateway-row …`). No registry publishes
  them, so even the container path starts with cloning this repository.
- Runtime configuration requires manually pairing `RCLWEBD_SUPPORT_ROW`,
  the sourced prefix, and `RMW_IMPLEMENTATION`
  ([ADR 0008](./0008-one-adapter-row-per-gateway-process.md)). The
  default row is J-FT, so `rclwebd` under a sourced Humble environment
  fails the adapter probe unless the user already knows the six-row
  taxonomy. `rclwebd/src/main.rs` currently warns on a `ROS_DISTRO`
  mismatch but keeps the wrong default.

The owner asked for an easier install and usage path (2026-08-14).

## Decision

Staged delivery; each stage is independently shippable, in this order.

1. **Publish the runtime images to GHCR from `release.yml`.**
   Per released version, push the six row images built from the existing
   Dockerfiles as `ghcr.io/alexzhang1030/rclwebd:<version>-<row>`
   (row in `j-ft`, `j-cy`, `j-zn`, `h-ft`, `h-cy`, `h-zn`), plus rolling
   per-row tags (`:<row>`) and aliases `:jazzy` (J-FT), `:humble`
   (H-FT), and `:latest` (J-FT).
   Authentication is the workflow `GITHUB_TOKEN` with `packages: write` —
   no new long-lived secrets, consistent with the
   [ADR 0016](./0016-oidc-trusted-publish.md) direction. Every tag is a
   `linux/amd64` + `linux/arm64` manifest list — robot compute is
   commonly arm64 — with each arch built natively (`ubuntu-24.04-arm`
   for arm64; QEMU-emulated cargo builds are impractical) and per-arch
   tags kept for platform pinning (owner ruling 2026-08-14: both
   architectures are required, superseding the amd64-first staging in
   the accepted proposal). The quickstart becomes one line with zero
   repository access:

   ```bash
   docker run --rm --network host ghcr.io/alexzhang1030/rclwebd:jazzy
   ```

2. **Auto-detect the support row from the sourced environment.**
   When `RCLWEBD_SUPPORT_ROW` is unset, derive the row from `ROS_DISTRO`
   (`jazzy` / `humble`) plus `RMW_IMPLEMENTATION` (default
   `rmw_fastrtps_cpp`) instead of hard-defaulting to J-FT. An explicit
   `RCLWEBD_SUPPORT_ROW` still wins; an unknown combination fails
   startup naming the six rows. This changes only how the one row per
   process is chosen — [ADR 0008](./0008-one-adapter-row-per-gateway-process.md)
   stands, and the adapter probe remains the consistency authority.
   `source /opt/ros/humble/setup.bash && rclwebd` then does the right
   thing with zero configuration.

3. **Lead the docs with the zero-clone path.**
   Root `README.md` and [deploy](../deploy.md) open with the
   `docker run` one-liner per distro; `cargo install rclwebd --features
   ros` moves to a build-from-source section. Keep one copy-paste
   "gateway in one minute" block per distro.

4. **Prebuilt binaries on GitHub Releases with an install script.**
   Build `rclwebd-<version>-{jazzy,humble}-{amd64,arm64}` (arm64 on the
   same native arm runners as the images) inside the same digest-pinned
   ROS builder stages the images use, so the glibc floor matches each
   distro's Ubuntu base (22.04 Humble, 24.04 Jazzy) and the Humble
   binaries get the regenerated bindings. Runtime still
   needs a matching sourced prefix — typesupport stays dlopen, which is
   the environment a ROS user already has. An `install.sh` detects
   `ROS_DISTRO` and architecture, downloads with retries
   ([gotcha](../../.agents/docs/gotchas.md#github-releases-downloads-need-retries)),
   and installs to `~/.local/bin`. This removes the Rust toolchain and
   the compile from host installs; `cargo install` remains for people
   who want to build.

**Evaluated and deferred:** a bloom / ROS buildfarm release
(`apt install ros-jazzy-rclwebd`). It is the most familiar channel for
ROS users, but it requires ament/colcon packaging of a Cargo workspace
and buildfarm acceptance — a large, externally gated effort. Revisit
after stages 1–4 land if users ask for apt. The own apt repo in
[ADR 0019](./0019-own-apt-repository.md) is that revisit for
`apt install rclwebd`; it is not bloom.

## Rationale

- The GHCR images remove all three install obstacles at once (Rust
  toolchain, dev prefix, compile time) and reuse Dockerfiles the repo
  already maintains for e2e and deploy. Publishing is the smallest
  possible delta: a push job on artifacts CI already knows how to build.
- Row auto-detection removes the most common usage failure: a sourced
  environment that disagrees with the J-FT default. The code already
  detects the mismatch and warns; deriving the default turns the warning
  case into correct behavior without weakening the probe.
- Prebuilt binaries serve hosts where Docker (or host networking) is
  unavailable or unwanted — common on robot compute — at the cost of a
  release matrix. Building them inside the digest-pinned builder images
  keeps one build environment per distro instead of a new toolchain
  story.
- Ordering: images first because they help every audience and carry the
  least risk; auto-detection second because it is a small code change
  with the largest usage-error payoff; binaries last because they add a
  release matrix that images already cover for most users.

## Consequences

- `release.yml` grows images, manifests, and binaries jobs. Image names
  and tags become public contract; renames need the same care as crate
  names.
- Per-release CI time grows (six rows × two architectures plus four
  binary builds, all parallel matrix jobs on native runners —
  `ubuntu-24.04-arm` for arm64).
- Stage 2 changes default behavior: a sourced Humble environment that
  previously selected J-FT (and failed the probe) now selects H-FT and
  starts. That is the intended fix; no working configuration changes
  meaning.
- `README.md`, [deploy](../deploy.md), and
  [gateway/rclwebd](../gateway/rclwebd.md) change in the same reviews
  that land each stage.

## Revisit triggers

- GHCR is unreachable for target users (air-gapped robots) — raises the
  priority of the binaries and apt paths.
- Cargo-in-colcon packaging matures — reopens the deferred buildfarm
  release. Users asking for apt is [ADR 0019](./0019-own-apt-repository.md).
- A new support row or a distro EOL changes the tag matrix.

## Source

Owner request 2026-08-14 (task): "rclwebd 的安装方式和使用方式现在还是太难了。
考虑使用更好的方式" — installation and usage of `rclwebd` are still too
hard; propose a better way. Owner accepted the staged proposal the same
day ("可以，你都搞一下把" — go ahead with all of it) without further
conditions.
