# 0003: Use one monorepo with explicit workspace ownership

## Status

Accepted. The `sdk/typescript/` / `@rclweb/sdk` workspace enrollment is
superseded by [ADR 0013](./0013-typescript-package-rclweb.md). Repository
licensing is Apache-2.0 as of 2026-08-13; see
[licensing](../licensing.md).

## Date

2026-08-10

## Context

rclweb spans Rust, MoonBit, TypeScript, shared protocol contracts, conformance fixtures, deployment assets, and documentation. Multi-language work needs one coordinated delivery surface while keeping language-specific dependency graphs and release units independent.

## Decision

Use one monorepo for Rust, MoonBit, TypeScript, R2WP contracts and fixtures, conformance, deployment, and documentation.

- The repository root owns orchestration, version pins, and shared verification commands (`just toolchain-check` / `check` / `test` / `build`).
- Mainline language workspaces for this phase:
  - `rclwebd/` — Cargo workspace member (Rust gateway library).
  - `rclmbt/` — `moon.work` member (MoonBit/Wasm runtime module).
  - `sdk/typescript/` — Bun workspace package `@rclweb/sdk`.
  - `examples/*` — reserved Bun workspace glob for mainline examples.
- Studio workspace enrollment begins at U0 after M3; M0–M3 keep `studio/` free of source and active workspace entries.
- Each language workspace owns its dependencies and internal package layout.
- Cross-language sharing uses versioned protocols, schemas, fixtures, generated-artifact manifests, and stable ABIs.
- Release units may version independently.
- Every cross-workspace dependency terminates at a versioned contract, schema, fixture, generated-artifact manifest, or stable ABI.

## Rationale

- One repository keeps M0–M3 contracts, fixtures, and evidence in lockstep with the code that implements them.
- Root-level orchestration provides clean-checkout commands.
- Each language toolchain keeps its own dependency graph.
- Versioned contracts and stable ABIs keep consumers explicit when ownership or release cadence differs.
- Independent release versioning lets SDK, gateway, protocol fixtures, and documentation ship on their own schedules after shared contract gates pass.

## Consequences

- M0-02 records exact pin files (`.bun-version`, `.moon-version`, `.just-version`, `rust-toolchain.toml`), lockfiles (`Cargo.lock`, `bun.lock`), and root recipes in the `justfile`.
- Shared-contract changes update fixtures and require review from every consuming owner.
- Generated artifacts publish through versioned manifests with explicit consumer imports; build outputs stay ignored (`target/`, `_build/`, `dist/`, `node_modules/`, `.mooncakes/`).
- Dependency resolution follows each ecosystem's workspace-level lock and pin conventions. Repository licensing is Apache-2.0; third-party crates on the published surface must be OSI-permissive ([licensing](../licensing.md)).
- Conformance, deployment, and documentation live in-tree with the mainline delivery sequence.

## Revisit triggers

- A language workspace gains release, licensing, or security isolation requirements that favor a separate repository.
- Cross-workspace coupling escapes the declared contract, schema, fixture, manifest, or ABI boundaries.
- Root orchestration or shared verification cost exceeds the coordination benefit for M0–M3 delivery.
